**Kubernetes DevOps Project**
This project demonstrates how to deploy and manage a simple DevOps application using Docker and Kubernetes. The goal is to containerize the application, deploy it using Kubernetes, and expose it via a service.

Project Structure
Dockerfile: Contains the instructions to build the Docker image for the DevOps application.

Kubernetes YAML files: Configuration files to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster, including Pods, Deployments, and Services.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Docker (for building and running Docker containers)

Kubernetes (for orchestrating containers)

kubectl (command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes)

Docker Desktop (for local Kubernetes cluster)

**Steps to Run the Application**
1. Build the Docker Image
First, build the Docker image for the application. Navigate to the project directory and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t my-devops-app .

2. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub (Optional)
If you want to use your image in Kubernetes, you need to push it to a container registry like Docker Hub.

bash
Copy
Edit
docker login
docker tag my-devops-app <your-dockerhub-username>/my-devops-app
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/my-devops-app

3. Create Kubernetes Deployment
Apply the Kubernetes deployment configuration to deploy the application. This will create a Pod running your Docker image.

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

4. Expose the Application via a Service
To expose your application, apply the service configuration.

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
5. Check the Pod Status
Ensure that the Pod is running correctly by checking its status:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get pods
You should see something like this:

perl
Copy
Edit
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-devops-app-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          1m

6. Port Forward to Access the Application
Once the Pod is running, you can access the application locally using kubectl port-forward:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl port-forward service/my-devops-app-service 8080:8080
Now you can access your application at http://localhost:8080.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with pulling the Docker image, ensure your image is pushed to Docker Hub (or any container registry) and the registry is accessible.

If the Kubernetes Pod status shows ImagePullBackOff, it typically means the image is not found or there are permission issues.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic Kubernetes deployment workflow for a DevOps application. You can modify this setup to suit more complex applications and environments.
